/* Hi-res TIM override system.
 *
 * When loose-file loading is enabled (g_PcConfig.allowLooseFiles), TIMs in
 * gamedata/load/ that are LARGER than the disc image's buffer slot are
 * treated as hi-res replacements. They cannot fit in PSX VRAM at native
 * resolution, so instead of overwriting the VRAM upload we:
 *   1. Parse the loose TIM (any bit depth) or PNG and decode to RGBA8
 *   2. Upload that decoded RGBA8 into a separate full-resolution GL texture
 *   3. Register the (vramX, vramY, vramW, vramH, clutX, clutY, bitDepth)
 *      tuple → GL texture mapping in a lookup table
 *   4. Let the disc image's native-res TIM upload to VRAM as normal (so
 *      VRAM still has consistent fallback data for any prim we don't catch)
 *
 * At draw time, the AddSplit hook in PsyX_GPU.cpp consults the table by the
 * incoming poly's (tpage, clut). On a match, the split's textureId is
 * redirected to the hi-res GL texture and its texFormat is forced to
 * TF_32_BIT_RGBA — which selects the direct-sample 32-bit RGBA shader that
 * already exists for DR_PSYX_TEX overrides. Sampling treats native PSX UVs
 * (0..vramSpanInPixels) as 0..1 of the hi-res texture, so any uniform
 * upscale factor (2×, 4×, 8×) Just Works.
 *
 * Limitations of v1:
 *   - One loose TIM is assumed to fully cover one tpage region. If a single
 *     tpage hosts two original disc TIMs (UV split layout), only one can be
 *     replaced at hi-res; the other prims still match the override and will
 *     sample from the wrong region.
 *   - 4bpp / 8bpp originals are matched via CLUT identity. If your loose
 *     replacement TIM uses a different CLUT layout than the original, the
 *     match fails (good — we fall back to native VRAM).

/* ---- Chunk-pool virtual slots (resident_textures) ----

 * Model_MaterialFlagsApply preserves across rebasing. The virtual key must
 * therefore survive "+64*row" without colliding with another slot:
 *
 *   imageDesc.clutX = (slotId % 64) * 16          -> clut word bits 0..5
 *   imageDesc.clutY = 512 + (slotId / 64) * 16    -> clut word bits 6..15
 *
 * Material_FsImageApply packs (clutY << 6) | (clutX >> 4): bit 15 set (no
 * valid PSX prim carries it — clutY 512+ doesn't exist), slot id split
 * across the X bits (row deltas never touch them) and 16-row-spaced Y
 * groups. Decode from a prim clut word:
 *
 *   q      = ((clut >> 6) & 0x3FF) - 512;         q < 0 -> not virtual
 *   slotId = (q / 16) * 64 + (clut & 0x3F);

 *
 * PoolSlotRegister decodes `data` (disc TIM or loose PNG/TIM replacement)
 * to RGBA8 — one texture PER CLUT ROW for TIMs (PNG has one palette: row 0)
 * — replacing in place on engine slot reuse. A row without a texture falls
 * back to row 0. nativePixelW/H are the DISC TIM's pixel dims — the UV
 * denominator — so a replacement of any resolution maps 0..1 over the
 * original. PoolSlotsReset frees everything below the chara range; called on
 * map (re)init.
 *
 * Slot id ranges:
 *   0..254   map chunk pool (192 full + 64 half virtual slots)
 *   255      bullet-decal texture (pc_decals.c)
 *   256+id   global chara pool (pc_chara_pool.c), id = e_CharaId. These
 *            PERSIST across map loads (PoolSlotsReset skips them). A chara
 *            TIM with more than 16 CLUT rows (PRS ships 48) spills rows
 *            16..31 into slot+64 and 32..47 into slot+128 — that aliasing is
 *            inherent to the clut-word encoding (row deltas of +64*row walk
 *            the Y groups), so 320..447 are reserved as spill space and must
 *            never be allocated directly. */
