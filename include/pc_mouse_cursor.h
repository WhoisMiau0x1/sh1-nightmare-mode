/* PC port: mouse control for cursor-driven puzzles + a clickable main menu.
 *
 * QoL enhancement (not 1:1 with the PSX original). Gated by config
 * `mouse_cursor` (default on) and only active when the OS cursor is free —
 * i.e. relative mouse mode is OFF, which is true in menus, puzzles and the
 * classic camera, but NOT in TPS/OTS/FPS where the pointer is captured for
 * look. See control_style.c for the capture logic.
 *
 * Puzzles: every free-cursor puzzle (piano, plate, door panels, alert door,
 * map pan) integrates the left analog stick, draws through Gfx_CursorDraw, and
 * confirms with the `enter` bind. We detect one is on screen via Gfx_CursorDraw
 * and inject mouse motion into the stick + a click into the controller, so the
 * puzzle's own cursor follows the mouse with no per-puzzle code.
 *
 * Menu: the title menu is discrete row-selection, so we hit-test the mouse
 * against the row bands, drive the selection on hover, and confirm on click. */
