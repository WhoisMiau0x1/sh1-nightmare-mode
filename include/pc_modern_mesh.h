 *
 * These were 0x2000 (8192) each, which was a conservative profile number rather
 * than anything the renderer required — and it defeated the point of the modern
 * path by refusing ordinary modern assets (a real replacement measured 6262
 * vertices / 11984 triangles and was rejected on triangles alone).
 *
 * The ONE hard constraint is the flattened draw buffer. Pc_ModernMesh_Emit
 * expands to a non-indexed triangle list of triangleCount*3 vertices, and
 * Pc_ModernVertex_Upload refuses count >= MAX_VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE. That buffer
 * is the modern path's OWN dedicated VBO (pc_modern_vertex.c allocates
 * sizeof(GrModernVertex) * MAX_VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE up front), NOT PsyCross's
 * shared g_vertexBuffer — so a dense item cannot starve the world render, and
 * the allocation is already paid whatever the caps say.
 *
 * So the triangle cap IS the buffer bound, derived rather than guessed. The
 * vertex cap gets the same figure: a source vertex only counts once it is
 * referenced, so it can never exceed the flattened output, and
 * PC_MODERN_MESH_MAX_FILE_BYTES still bounds the file itself.
 *
 * MAX_VERTEX_BUFFER_SIZE lives in PsyX_render.h, which this header does not
 * include (it is consumed by plain C game code); the value is mirrored with a
 * compile-time check in pc_modern_mesh.c that it still matches. */
