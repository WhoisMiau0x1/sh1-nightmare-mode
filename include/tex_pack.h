 *   texupload-{C16|STC16}-{srcHash}-{WxH}-{ox}-{oy}-{wxh}.png
 *
 * where srcHash = XXH3-64 of the VRAM write payload (for us: the TIM pixel
 * block, row-major halfwords), palHash = XXH3-64 of the CLUT halfwords
 * (all 16 for 4bpp / 256 for 8bpp when the P range is full; DuckStation's
 * partial-range quirk hashes the FIRST palMax-palMin+1 entries), WxH = the
 * write size in VRAM halfwords, and ox/oy/wxh = the replaced sub-rectangle
 * in native texels. One upload can have many sub-rectangle replacements;
 * TexPack_Compose rebuilds the whole upload at the pack's scale and blits
 * each matching image over it, mirroring DuckStation's compositor.
 *
 * Entries may also be .dds (BC7). A .dds covering the whole upload is handed
 * back compressed for a 4x cheaper VRAM upload (see TexPack_LastComposeIsDds);
 * one that only covers a sub-rectangle is BC7-decoded on the CPU and blitted
 * like a PNG, since the compositor works in 32-bit pixels. */

 *
 * Like DuckStation, an entry is the piece of the sheet ONE OBJECT draws, seen
 * through the palette that object selects — not the whole sheet. The piece is
 * the UV bounding box of one model over the sheet, read out of the .ILM/.PLM/
 * .IPD by TexPack_DumpScanLm; the sheet a box belongs to is the material name,
 * which is also the TIM name. A sheet no model ever references (fonts, HUD, 2D
 * screens) still falls back to one whole-upload entry per CLUT row.
 *
 * Both calls are no-ops unless g_PcConfig.dumpTextures: nothing is hashed,
 * scanned, allocated or written when the option is off. Entries already dumped
 * (this session or a previous one) are skipped, so a long play session writes
 * each file exactly once. 24bpp uploads are skipped — the pack name grammar
 * cannot express them. */
