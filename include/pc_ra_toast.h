/*
 * pc_ra_toast.h - animated achievement-unlock toast.
 *
 * Console-style popup: the badge flies up from the bottom edge as the trophy
 * sound plays, the panel expands so the badge slides left and the text emerges
 * to its right, the text alternates between the achievement name and its
 * description, then the whole thing reverses back out.
 *
 * Main thread only. Drawing happens from the PsyX post-capture hook, so it
 * animates on wall-clock time and keeps running while the game is paused.
