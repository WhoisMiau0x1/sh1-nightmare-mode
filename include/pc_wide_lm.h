/* v7 high-poly ILM support — detection + parse + registry + lifetime.
 *
 * A v7 file is a NARROW v6-shaped spine (a real s_LmHeader: materials,
 * modelHdrs with names + 0xB draw-chain bits, modelOrder — but meshCount=0 on
 * every part, so the stock walkers draw nothing) plus a PC-only u32 GEOMETRY
 * blob keyed by modelFileIdx that a separate wide drawer consumes. This TU
 * detects v7 in LmHeader_FixOffsets_PC, reformats the spine exactly as the v6
 * path does, and registers the wide blob. On ANY failure the spine alone is
 * left standing (meshCount=0 -> invisible, non-corrupting) — always fallback.
 *
 * See docs and the Stage v7 loader spec. Wide-blob record layout mirrors the
 * converter's _emit_wide_ilm in pc_port/tools/ilm_obj.py. */
